// package webhelp is a bunch of useful utilities for doing web programming
// in Go. webhelp encourages you to use the standard library for web
// programming, but provides some oft-needed tools to help simplify the task.
//
// webhelp tightly integrates with the new Go 1.7 Request Context support,
// but has backported the functionality to previous Go releases in the whcompat
// subpackage.
//
// Recently I wrote a long blog post about how to use webhelp:
